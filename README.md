Mood classification was performed on a dataset of over 160,000 songs.

Clustering techniques, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, were applied to categorize the unlabeled data.

For classification of the labeled data, various machine learning algorithms were implemented, such as Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

The performance of these models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
